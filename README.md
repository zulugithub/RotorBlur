![Alt text](https://github.com/zulugithub/RotorBlur/blob/main/RotorBlur.png?raw=true "Title")

## Introduction

Rotor blur similar to DCS' blur.

A second camera renders the complex 3D rotor geometry into a “render texture” that is projected onto a simple shell body ("cylinder") by a custom shader.
